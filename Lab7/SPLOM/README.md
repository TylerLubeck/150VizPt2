### Question A ###

When dragging from top to bottom in a box, all points in the row are 
highlighted from top to bottom as well, because they share the same Y axis.
There is no clear correlation for items in the column.

### Question B ###

When dragging from left to right in a box, all points in the column are
highlighted from left to right as well, because they share the same X axis.
there is no clear correlation for items in the row.

### Question C ###

Sepal Width seems to be causing this outlier.
Without the visualization, we could have figured this out with a machine 
learning algorithm for outlier detection.
