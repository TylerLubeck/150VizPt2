The `a1` directory contains the sketch for the "Basic Requirements". If you are on
a linux system you should be able to cd into a1 then execute "./run" to run the sketch.

The `funding` directory contains the sketch for the "Additional Requirements". This
sketch also has a "./run" script for executing the sketch.

NOTE: must have "processing-java" installed somewhere in your path to use our "run" scripts.
