Additional things we did:
> Ordered the nodes by mass so that smaller nodes are drawn on top of the larger ones.
> Implemented a color scheme where heavier nodes show in darker shades of blue.
> Not that this is revolutionary or anything, but display the current system energy while the program runs.
> Implemented id and mass display if you hover over a node. 
> We did all of the additional requirements: boundaries, resizing, and settle at center of screen.
